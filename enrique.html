          <li><b>2023 - </b>Enrique gets a large anonymous donation with a request to organize the first annual Raymus Film Festival, with a focus on small-town horror</li>          
          <li><b>2024 - </b>Ramos Productions goes public, reaching a high of $120 per share. 23% of Americans have reported very specific, similar dreams involving Enrique speaking to them in a calming yet forceful voice</li>
          <li><b>2026 - </b>Enrique receives his PhD in Media, Culture, and Communication from NYU. His thesis focuses on a controversial study from the 90s, where subjects were treated to short bursts of psychedelic television</li>
          <li><b>2027 - </b>Unbeknownst to the American public, Dr. Ramos begins holding private showings of experimental film to celebrities from various cultures, with intent of commanding them through subliminal messaging</li>
          <li><b>2029 - </b>A study commissioned by the FTC finds that 48% of Americans have read a Ramos Productions comic in the last year, with a third of those donating funds to Dr. Ramos despite the 2028 recession</li>
          <li><b>2032 - </b>The finale of the "Welcome to Monteca" comic series is published to universal acclaim, critics herald it as the "Twin Peaks we never had"</li>
          <li><b>2033 - </b>Dr. Enrique Ramos accepts a deal for "Ramosville", a movie adaptation of his "Monteca" flagship comic series. He chooses upstart actor Noah Ledesma for the role of the main character</li>

          <li><b>2037 - </b>Cyborg Enrique appears on television screens across the nation, commanding the common media consumer to rise up and defend his ideology. Mass riots follow, described thereafter as the "Enrique Event"</li>
          <li><b>2038 - </b>On the 19th of January, the computer storing Enrique's consciousness encounters a time-formatting bug due to its reliance on measuring time as a 32-bit signed integer. Ryan Shaw later reveals he intended for this bug to occur so that Dr. Ramos would be defeated. Cyborg Enrique promptly crashes and shuts down permanently. Ramos Productions is taken over by Noah Ledesma, and now makes B-tier video game adaptations.</li>
        </ul>

        <em id="quote">"Enrique's life will be remembered as one of terror; however, his advances in experimental media and the small-town horror genre will be far-reaching for future generations. One man changed the world, and had to be stopped before he changed it too much." -- Researcher Ryan Shaw</em>
